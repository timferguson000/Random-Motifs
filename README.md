# random-motif
Code for the generation of generalized Erdös-Rényi random graphs with prescribed second order motif distributions. This is a numerical implementation (both Python and Java) of my publication “Motifs, coherent configurations and second order network generation” with my doctoral advisor Jared Bronski in Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena.
